# TypeScript-Seed-Project
TypeScript Seed Project - Built with Webpack 4

The main purpose of this repository is to show a good end-to-end project setup and workflow for writing Node code in TypeScript. We will try to keep this as up-to-date as possible, but community contributions and recommendations for improvements are encouraged and will be most welcome.
